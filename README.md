# Multi-threaded Image Processing

This project demonstrates multi-threaded image processing using both Python and Java. The goal is to implement various image filters and techniques to process images efficiently by utilizing threading to improve performance.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main components:

- **Java Image Processing**:
  - Implements multiple filters, including Sobel, Gaussian, and Sepia.
  - Utilizes Java's threading capabilities to enhance performance in an interactive GUI application.

- **Python Image Processing**:
  - Focuses on implementing Sobel edge detection and thresholding.
  - Employs Pythonâ€™s threading to handle image processing in chunks.

## Features

- Multi-threaded Implementation: Both Java and Python implementations use multi-threading to process images faster by dividing the workload across multiple threads.
- Multiple Filters: The Java component includes various filters such as:
- Sobel Filter: Detects edges in images.
- Gaussian Filter: Applies Gaussian blur to images.
- Sepia Filter: Applies a warm tone effect to images.
- Sobel Edge Detection: The Python component focuses on the Sobel operator for edge detection, showcasing its application in image processing.
